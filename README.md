## ACard
Hello everyone, This is my one of my solo projects from my FullStack Web Developer course 
I carefully designed this project to match the exact specifications given in the assignment.

## About
I've created a user-friendly web app that focuses on advertising cards. These cards can represent either businesses or stores. The platform caters to two types of users: businesses, who have the ability to create and showcase their cards for advertising, and casual users, who can simply browse and view these cards.

## Run the project
Open http://localhost:3000

Terminal 1 :"json-server --watch db.json --port 8000"

Terminal 2: "npm start"
